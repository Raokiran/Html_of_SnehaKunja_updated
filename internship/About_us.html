<h3>OUR PATH</h3>
<p> The Snehakunja Trust is a non-profit charitable organization dedicated to facilitating, promoting, and executing holistic health, rural development, environmental advocacy and conservation of coastal and Western Ghat diversity. The Snehakunja Trust was established by visionary philanthropist and a surgeon Dr. Kusuma Sorab (1937-98) as a charitable trust to provide quality community health services at affordable cost. Under her eminent leadership the Vivekananda Arogyadhama was built to serve the health care needs of the community. While our historical roots (established in 1976) were founded in the field of ayurvedic health, we recognize that conservation of livelihoods require an integrated approach and linkages with markets, credit and natural resources.</p>

Snehakunja health care services include Vivekananda wellness centre and Vivekananda home for elderly care. In the current life situation, Due to increased migration of younger population to urban areas, the family support to elderly has been deteriorating and there is an urgent need to provide the medical services to elderly people.
